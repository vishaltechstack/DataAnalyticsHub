Universal Functions, or ufuncs, are built-in NumPy functions that operate element by element on arrays.
They work on arrays of any shape and are implemented in C, so they are very fast.

Common ufunc categories:
    • Math: add, subtract, multiply, divide
    • Trigonometric: sin, cos, tan
    • Comparison: greater, less, equal
    • Statistical: minimum, maximum

Why Use Universal Functions?

1. Speed
They are much faster than Python loops because they run at a low level.

2. Clean code
No need for for loops. Code is short and readable.

3. Works on arrays of any size
Same function works for 1D, 2D, or higher dimensions.

4. Broadcasting support
They automatically handle operations between arrays of different shapes.

What is Vectorization?

Vectorization means performing operations on entire arrays at once, instead of looping through elements one by one.
In NumPy, vectorization is achieved using ufuncs and broadcasting.


Vectorized code:
    • Runs faster
    • Uses less code
    • Is easier to read

How Universal Functions and Vectorization are Related
    • ufuncs enable vectorization
    • Vectorization is the concept
    • ufuncs are the tool that make it possible
