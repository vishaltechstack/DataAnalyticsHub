Polars is a DataFrame library built in Rust with a Python API.
It is designed for speed, low memory usage, and clean syntax.

Key ideas:
    • Column-based operations
    • Lazy execution (optional but powerful)
    • Very fast for large datasets
    • Great alternative to Pandas for analytics and data engineering

Install it first:
    pip install polars

Polars vs Pandas (quick comparison):
    • Polars is faster for large datasets
    • Cleaner syntax with expressions
    • Lazy execution is a big advantage
    • Pandas still better for quick ad-hoc work and Excel-heavy workflows

When to Use Polars (real advice)

Use Polars if:
    • Data is large
    • Performance matters
    • You are building pipelines
    • You want cleaner, predictable transformations

Stick to Pandas if:
    • Heavy Excel usage
    • Very small datasets
    • Existing Pandas-only codebase
