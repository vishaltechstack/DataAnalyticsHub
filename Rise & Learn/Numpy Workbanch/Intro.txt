🔢 NumPy (Numerical Python) is a core Python library used for numerical computing.
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
along with a rich set of mathematical functions to operate on them efficiently.

👉 NumPy is the foundation for libraries like Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

🚀 Why NumPy?
-------------
Python lists are flexible, but they are slow and memory-inefficient for numerical operations.
NumPy solves this by:
    • Storing data in contiguous memory
    • Using C-optimized code under the hood
    • Enabling vectorized operations (no loops!)

⭐ Key Features of NumPy
------------------------
    • N-Dimensional Array (ndarray)
    • Fast mathematical operations
    • Broadcasting
    • Linear algebra support
    • Random number generation
    • Integration with C/C++ & Fortran

📦 Installing NumPy
-------------------
pip install numpy

📌 Importing NumPy
------------------
import numpy as np
