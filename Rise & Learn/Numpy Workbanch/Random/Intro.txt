Random numbers are used to simulate real-world data, test algorithms, and build models in data science and machine learning.
NumPy provides a powerful module called numpy.random to generate random values efficiently.

Random does not mean truly unpredictable. NumPy generates pseudo-random numbers, which means results can be reproduced if needed.

Why Random Numbers Are Important:
    • Create sample datasets
    • Test code and algorithms
    • Initialize weights in machine learning
    • Run simulations and probability experiments
