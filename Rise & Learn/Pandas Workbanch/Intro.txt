Pandas is one of the most important Python libraries for data analysis and data handling.
If you are working with data in Python, Pandas is something you will use almost daily.

At a high level, Pandas helps you:
    • Read data from files like CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and JSON
    • Clean messy or missing data
    • Analyze and transform datasets
    • Perform fast calculations and aggregations
    • Prepare data for visualization or machine learning

Why Pandas is so popular:
    • Built on top of NumPy, so it is fast and efficient
    • Very easy to work with structured data (rows and columns)
    • Powerful functions for filtering, grouping, and merging data
    • Widely used in data analysis, data science, and analytics roles



Core Data Structures in Pandas

1. Series
A one-dimensional labeled array.
Think of it as a single column of data with an index.

Example:
    • A list of marks
    • Daily temperatures
    • Sales numbers for one product

2. DataFrame
A two-dimensional table made of rows and columns.
This is the most commonly used Pandas object.

Example:
    • Excel-like tables
    • SQL query results
    • CSV datasets



Where Pandas is used
    • Data cleaning and preprocessing
    • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    • Financial and business analytics
    • Preparing data for machine learning models
    • Reporting and dashboard support



What you should know before starting
    • Basic Python (variables, lists, dictionaries)
    • Basic understanding of data (rows, columns, tables)
