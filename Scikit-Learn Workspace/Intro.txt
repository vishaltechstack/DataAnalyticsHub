scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

It is used for:
    • Data preprocessing
    • Supervised learning
    • Unsupervised learning
    • Model evaluation
    • Model selection

It follows a consistent API, which makes learning and switching models easy.

Installation:
pip install scikit-learn


Core API Design (Very Important)

Almost everything in scikit-learn follows this pattern:
    • Create model
    • Fit model
    • Predict
    • Evaluate

Common Methods:
    • fit(X, y)
    • predict(X)
    • fit_transform(X)
    • transform(X)
    • score(X, y)
    • get_params()
    • set_params()


Commonly Used Base Classes:
    • BaseEstimator
    • TransformerMixin
    • ClassifierMixin
    • RegressorMixin
Used when creating custom models or transformers.

Typical End-to-End Workflow:
    • Load data
    • Clean data
    • Split data
    • Scale features
    • Train model
    • Evaluate
    • Tune
    • Save model
